# Golf Score Tracker and Analysis App üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚õ≥Ô∏è

Welcome to the Golf-Klubben app! The purpose of this application is to allow the player to add and save their rounds in the app. It also enables tracking the development of the number of strokes.

## Key Features

- **Score Tracking:** Easily record your golf scores for each round. 
- **Hole-by-Hole Stats:** Analyze your performance on a per-hole basis, allowing you to identify strengths and weaknesses.
- **Averages and Trends:** Keep track of your overall game averages, helping you set and achieve personal improvement goals.
- **SQLite Database:** Golf-Klubben uses an SQLite database to store player's game rounds and scores. This allows for the recording of game results and their later review.

## How To Use
- On the homepage navigate your way to record your game by pressing "Pelaa golfia!". Then add your score and save it for later. 
- If you want to go through your old rounds, simply press "Selaa kierroksia"-button on the app!


## Important information
- The application is still in the development phase, and for this reason, at this point, you can only save par-3 results. Additional features will be added as the project progresses.
